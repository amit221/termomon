### Collect compis while you code — without ever leaving your agent.

Your coding activity spawns unique ASCII creatures with randomized traits across 6 rarity tiers.
Scan to discover them. Catch the ones you want. Breed pairs to pass rare traits to the next generation. **Hundreds of millions of possible combinations.**

Works with **Claude Code** | **Cursor** | and more coming soon

## How It Works

```
1. Code normally        Your prompts, tool calls, and commits generate "ticks"
2. Compis spawn         Every ~30 minutes a batch of 3-5 compis appears nearby
3. Scan & catch         Run /scan to see them, /catch to grab the ones you want
4. Breed next-gen       Pair two compis to produce a child that inherits their best traits
```

Each compi belongs to one of **7 species** and is built from a handful of trait slots (typically eyes, mouth, body, tail) — each with its own rarity and unique ASCII art. Rarer traits glow in different colors, from gray commons to red mythics.

## Why Compi?

- **Zero context-switching** — the game lives inside your coding agent, not a separate app
- **Your work fuels the game** — compis spawn from your actual coding activity
- **Real depth** — 7 species, 8 rarity tiers, weighted catch rates, breeding with rarity upgrades, cross-species hybrids, streaks, leveling
- **Every compi is unique** — species × trait variants × 8 colors = hundreds of millions of combos
- **Lightweight** — hooks only, no background processes, no performance impact
- **Open source** — MIT licensed, community-driven

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add amit221/compi
/plugin install compi@compi
```

Then enable auto-update so you always get the latest version:
1. Type `/plugin` to open the plugin manager
2. Go to the **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select **compi**
4. Enable **auto-update**

**Optional: add a dedicated `compi` alias**

For the best experience, add a shell alias that launches a lightweight Compi-only session (Haiku model, Compi tools + file/CLI access):

```bash
alias compi='claude --model haiku --verbose --allowedTools "mcp__plugin_compi_compi__*" "Read" "Write" "Edit" "Bash"'
```

Add it to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.profile`). **PowerShell** users — add this to your profile (`$PROFILE`) instead:

```powershell
function compi { & claude.cmd --model haiku --verbose --allowedTools "mcp__plugin_compi_compi__*" "Read" "Write" "Edit" "Bash" @args }
```

Then just run `compi` to start a dedicated session.

### Cursor

> Requires **Cursor 2.5 or later** (plugins support was added in 2.5).

Compi isn't on the official Cursor Marketplace yet, but Cursor's `/add-plugin` command can install any plugin directly from a GitHub repository. In an Agent chat, type:

```
/add-plugin compi@https://github.com/amit221/compi
```

> `/add-plugin` won't appear in autocomplete — type the full command.

Then **restart Cursor** and verify it shows up under **Settings → Plugins**.

On Cursor, Compi runs as a stdio MCP server that Cursor spawns on demand and renders output as an HTML panel via MCP Apps. The slash commands (`/scan`, `/catch`, `/collection`, …) work the same as in Claude Code.

## Playing

### `/play` — the AI companion (recommended)

Just type **`/play`** and let the AI guide you. No commands to memorize — it reads your game state, shows what's happening, adds strategic insights, and asks what you'd like to do. You respond in plain English:

```
/play

  ⚡ 28/30  |  🏆 Lv.4  |  💰 12g  |  📦 8/20

  🔍 3 creatures nearby
  🥚 Ivory + Blaze can breed
  ⬆️ Drift's mouth → rank 2 for 3g

  A Pyrax just showed up — you've never caught one before!
  Discovery XP bonus if you grab it. What would you like to do?

> catch the pyrax

  [real catch output with ASCII art...]

  Nice! First Pyrax in your collection — +20 discovery XP.
  You now have a breeding pair (Ivory + Blaze).
  Want to breed them, or keep scanning?
```

The companion shows real game output, adds strategic context to every option, and keeps going until you're done.

### Other ways to play

**Dedicated Compi session** — run the `compi` alias (see Installation) to open a lightweight Haiku-powered session focused on the game.

**Play alongside your work** — Compi runs in the background of any Claude Code or Cursor session. Compis spawn as you work — interact with `/scan`, `/catch`, `/breed` at any time without interrupting your workflow.

## Commands

| Command | CLI | What it does |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **`/play`** | — | **AI companion mode** — guided gameplay with strategic insights |
| `/scan` | `compi scan` | Show one nearby creature — catch it or scan for the next |
| `/catch` | `compi catch 1` | Catch the creature shown by scan |
| `/collection` | `compi collection` | Browse your caught creatures and their traits |
| `/breed [a] [b]` | `compi breed [a] [b]` | Breed any two creatures — same species upgrades rarity, cross-species creates hybrids |
| `/species` | `compi species` | Species discovery index — track rarity tiers found per species |
| `/archive [id]` | `compi archive [id]` | View your archive, or move a creature into it |
| `/energy` | `compi energy` | Check your current energy level |
| `/status` | `compi status` | Player profile, stats, and progress |
| `/settings` | `compi settings` | Configure notifications and preferences |
| `/create-species` | — | Generate a new creature species using AI |
| `/list` | `compi list` | Show all available Compi commands |

> **Tip — just use `/play`.** It's the easiest way to experience Compi. The AI reads your game state, suggests moves, and executes them when you say yes. Individual commands are still available for power users who prefer direct control.
