Parse the argument for which creature number (1-indexed) from the scan list.

Usage: `/catch [number]`

1. Call the `mcp__plugin_compi_compi__catch` tool with the parsed `index` (number).
2. Then run this Bash command to display the result with colors:
   ```
   cat "$LOCALAPPDATA/Temp/compi_display.txt" && rm -f "$LOCALAPPDATA/Temp/compi_display.txt"
   ```

After both steps, respond with ONLY:
"Press Ctrl+O to expand the output above and see the result."

Do NOT describe the catch result.
